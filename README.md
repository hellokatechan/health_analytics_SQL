# Health Analytics Case Study

We’ve just received an urgent request from the General Manager of Analytics at Health Co requesting our assistance with their analysis of the health.user_logs dataset.

The Health Co analytics team have shared with us their SQL script - they unfortunately ran into a few bugs that they couldn’t fix!

We’ve been asked to quickly debug their SQL script and use the resulting query outputs to quickly answer a few questions that the GM has requested for a board meeting about their active users.

# Business Questions
Before we start digging into the SQL script - let’s cover the business questions that we need to help the GM answer!

How many unique users exist in the logs dataset?
How many total measurements do we have per user on average?
What about the median number of measurements per user?
How many users have 3 or more measurements?
How many users have 1,000 or more measurements?
Looking at the logs data - what is the number and percentage of the active user base who:

Have logged blood glucose measurements?
Have at least 2 types of measurements?
Have all 3 measures - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?
For users that have blood pressure measurements:

What is the median systolic/diastolic blood pressure values?
